1. Is there a minimum number of words that constitute a valid sentence? (Ex. Is this a sentence? "Yes.")
2. Does a number count as a word? And if so, does it need to meet the minimum length requirement? (Ex. "There are 7 days in a week.")
3. How would you handle something like "..." used in a sentence?  Should it be ignored or should it be counted as three sentences?

4. Is it necessary to recognize a hyphenated word that wraps across 2 lines at a hard line break (i.e. Wednes-day where the 'day' portion is on a new line) as a single word or is it okay to interpret as 2 separate words?
5. Is it safe to assume punctuation without any whitespace does NOT delimit words (i.e. '2,347' and '$1,000.00' are each counted as one word)?
6. Is it okay to count a sequence of non alphanumeric characters, i.e. ??? or :-), as a word?
