# **Requirements Document -- Team 18**

##1 User Requirements

This section describes the intended users of the system,  what they expect the software to be able to do, and how they expect to interact with the system.

###1.1 User Characteristics

General characteristics of the intended users of the product, including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.

###1.2 System's functionality

Requirements written from the point of view of end users, usually expressed in narrative form.

###1.3 User Interfaces

Interfaces between the software product and its users; that is, how the users will interact with the system.

##2 System Requirements

These subsections contain all the software requirements at a level of detail sufficient to enable designers/developers to design/develop a system that satisfies those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements. This part of the document should provide a numbered (possibly hierarchical) list of simple, complete, and consistent functional and non-functional requirements.
