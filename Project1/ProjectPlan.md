# **Project Plan -- Team 18**
-------------------------
##1 Introduction

In our first project, team-18 will develop a software program that help instructor Lauren's writing class. Lauren is our client who request to develop a software tool for her teaching purpose. She is an instructor at a university nearby the Udacity. She is teaching a class which is required her students to write essays. Her students wrote very long and wordy sentences in their essays. Lauren want to help her students improving their writing styles. Therefore, she came to the Udacity and asked for help on developing a software tool to track the length of sentences in her student's essays.
Our team-18 will take these requirements and develop a software tool that counts the average number of words per sentence in a file. We will write the program in Java. We are planning to test the program on a machine with the vanilla installation of Java 1.7. The program will compile on the command line using the Javac command witout any additional options. The source code will include all code required to execute the program that is not part of the standard JDK. The program is an application software that it have a main method and should be executable from the command line using the Java command. The client should be able to prompt a file path to the file they wish to be analyzed as a command line argument. the client should be able to prompt the specific delimiters as sentence separators, using the flag -d and referring the Lauren's initial thoughts on the delimiters. the client should be able to prompt a lower limit for word length, using the flag -1, referring to Lauren's guess at what value might be good to use. Finally, the program can provide an integer output for the length of the average sentence in the file.
